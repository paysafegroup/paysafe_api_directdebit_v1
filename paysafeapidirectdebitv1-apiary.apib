# Overview
Connect your application with the Paysafe payment engine through our RESTful API and access a full suite of methods, including Purchases and Standalone Credits.
* Obtain output in JSON format that’s easily parsed by wide range of Web and mobile applications.
* Use any language or platform to make requests through standard HTTP protocols.

**Start accepting Direct Debit payments**

Once you have set up a Paysafe merchant account, you can connect to the Paysafe gateway with our simple-to-use API. 

Here is a summary of the process:
 1. You send a transaction request, including bank information and purchase amount. 
 2. Paysafe processes the request. 
 3. The transaction is completed in real time, though in most cases the request clears in 3–5 business days, at which time payment will be deposited in your business bank account.
 4. You can look up any Direct Debit transaction you have processed with Paysafe, including charges and credits. 
 
**Direct Debit workflow**

The flow of funds in a Direct Debit charge transaction is depicted in the diagram below.

![](https://developer.paysafe.com/fileadmin/flarecontent/devcentre/Content/Resources/Images/DD_Processing_Overview_Paysafe.png)

1. The customer places an order on the merchant's website.
2. The merchant securely transfers the order information (including bank information and purchase amount) to Paysafe. Note that for certain bank schemes, a mandate reference number must be included in the request.
3. Paysafe sends the transaction request to a Direct Debit clearing house.
4. The Direct Debit charge request is routed to the customer's bank. At this point, the bank information is verified.
5. The transaction is approved by the customer's bank and the approval relayed via Paysafe to the Merchant server.
6. The customer is informed of the approval.
7. The customer's bank transfers the moixedney to the merchant's bank account.
8. The transaction is completed in real time, but in most cases the request clears in 3–5 business days, by which time payment will be deposited in the merchant's business bank account. Merchants can look up any Direct Debit transaction they have processed with Paysafe, including charges and credits, using either the Direct debit API or the Paysafe Merchant Back Office.

# Authentication 
In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system
and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:
 * Key Username – MerchantXYZ
 * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e
Note this is not the same as your Merchant Back Office username and password.Ke
The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
 1. The Key Username and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key Username:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key Username and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

``Authorization: Basic
TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=``

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.

<a name="pagination" title="Pagination"></a>
# Pagination

In the case where an API GET request returns multiple results, Paysafe returns the first 10 records by default and uses HATEOAS links to provide page navigation. In addition to the default behavior, it is also possible to control the number of results and starting point by passing in query parameters as follows:

|    Name       | Description   |
|---            |---            |
| limit         | This is the total number of records to return. Max = 50. Default = 10. |
| offset        | This is the starting position, where 0 is the first record. Default = 0. |
| startDate     | This is the start date in UTC. Default = 30 days before the *endDate*.|
| endDate       | This is the end date in UTC. Default = current date and time. |

# Global Invalid Characters

You must not include any of the characters in the following table as values in any of your request parameters. If you do, your request will result in an error.

# API

The Direct Debit API allows merchants to process echeck transactions using the REST protocol. The protocol uses JSON for all requests and responses.

The following request types are supported: 

  * [Purchases](#purchaserequest)
  * [Standalone Credits](#standalonecreditrequest)
  
**Note:** The availability of request types is allotted on a merchant-by-merchant basis, since not all merchant banks support all operations. If you have any questions, contact your account manager.

## Direct Debit Return Codes

Occasionally, a Direct Debit API request will be successful, but can fail at the banking network level, e.g., due to insufficient funds or bank account closure. In such cases, the bank scheme provides a Return Code as an explanation. Because Direct Debit requests can take up to 7 days to clear, you cannot be notified of errors such as these via the API response. 
However, you can use the [Paysafe Merchant Back Office](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-api/reference-information/managing-payments/paysafe-merchant-back-office/) to run reports to view Return Codes in the case where a Direct Debit request has failed.

# Using the Example API Calls (Console Window)
To configure and test the API examples, first click on one of the API calls in the API Reference section and then click **Switch to Console** in the right hand pane. 
Using the Console window you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint. 
For example, for many requests you must update the endpoint to include your account ID, which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the **ACCOUNT_ID** value. 
(To get your account ID, log into the Paysafe Back Office, choose **Accounts** and look in the *Account* column). You must choose an account which has been enabled for the direct debit method
you wish to use. You must also update the Header to include your API Key by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value using the Base64
version of your API key. To get your API key, log into the test version of the Merchant Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**. 
Click *View Base 64 Encoded* and copy the key to your clipboard. Paste the key after the word Basic to replace the text YOUR-BASE64-ENCODED-API-KEY.
When you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system. 
* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.
